The complexity of systems in bio-network studies requires a method of study to simplify these networks into meaningful subdivisions. 
Their importance can then be quantified according to predefined centrality measures, to better understand the functions of these systems. 
We critically examine Koschu ̈tzki and Schreiber’s approach to ranking genes in gene regulatory networks and note that there are other ways 
to rank genes apart from using correlation co- efficients for different centrality measures. Through an extensive literature review, we 
find that Koschützki and Schreiber’s paper still remains one of the few definitive studies of ranking hierarchically significant genes 
after 11 years from publication.
