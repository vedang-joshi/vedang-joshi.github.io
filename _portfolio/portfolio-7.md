Patients suffering from motor impairments often require long medical treatments. We propose the first step in their 
treatment: to create a virtual player which follows the human player in order to create a synchronous movement, 
creating a bond between the human and the virtual players. While such coordination between a human and a virtual 
player has been studied in previous investigations, the potential use of such virtual environments in the field of 
motor rehabilitation is still unexplored. This paper uses a PI controller to accurately track the human playerâ€™s 
position and velocity and shows the spatial and temporal errors in the tracking and proposes future improvements 
to the study.
