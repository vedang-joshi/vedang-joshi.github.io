Supervisorâ€™s concluding comments: "A truly outstanding project from beginning to end both in its management, execution and final outcome. The strength of this EPQ is its unquestionable ambition as the candidate embarks on a topic requiring mastery of mathematical knowledge way beyond A-Level, which the candidate taught himself and it is also in a topic which spans over many specialist areas. All is overcome and the steadfast clear aims and objectives outlined at the beginning all come to fruition by the end."
