Comments: This is a very interesting and well researched essay. The discussion of ignorance is well done. I like the example which relates ignorance to imprecision of evidence, although I couldn't give it quite as many marks as I would have as I couldn't take account of the appendix. The section on DS theory and imprecise probability was also very well researched. You are right p-boxes are an interesting form of imprecise probability. Maybe I should include them in the syllabus next year. The only section which could have done with more discussion was on bayesian reasoning.
