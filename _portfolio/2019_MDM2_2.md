The complexity in modelling aircraft pitch dynamics arises from the need to understand non-linear modelling. 
We use simple Euler method approximations, in two of the three models we present, and MATLAB’s powerful ODE solver 
in one of the models. We analyse how pitch angles and linear velocities change in time in the body axes of the aircraft 
and talk about how unstable motion demonstrates “phugoid” and “short period” behaviour. We demonstrate our models on light 
aircraft types i.e. Cessna 172 and 182. We present the entire code used to simulate all models and unlike other studies in 
literature, which reduces the repeatability of results.
