I am a third year undergraduate at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk) studying for an integrated masters degree in [Engineering Mathematics](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/departments/engineering-mathematics/). I'm fortunate to have travelled the world extensively, and am originally from Pune, India, where I spent some my childhood, the rest I spent in the UK in Swindon. It was during my talks with a cousin of mine who's finishing her doctorate, who works in systems biology, that I realised the potential of mathematics in biology, and I was hooked! 

My area of interest thus lies at the interface of mathematics and biology, specifically to use network theory and other mathematical understanding such as non-linear dynamics to study complex systems, emergent phenomena with uses in comprehending animal behaviour. I've studied gene essentiality in mitochondrial protein interaction networks, and currently I'm interested in epidemiological dynamics.
