I am a fourth year student at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk) studying for an integrated masters degree in [Engineering Mathematics](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/departments/engineering-mathematics/). I am originally from Pune, India, where I spent some of my childhood, the rest of which I spent in Swindon, United Kingdom. It was during my talks with a cousin of mine who works in systems biology along with the projects I'd done at school and university, that I realised the potential of mathematical modelling to understand biological systems - I was hooked! 

My research interests lie at the interface of mathematics and biology. Specifically, I'm interested in network theory and non-linear dynamics and its applications to complex systems and emergent phenomena. I've worked on gene essentiality in mitochondrial protein-protein interaction networks at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/biomathematics-group/), and currently I'm working on how road networks act as potential vectors for plant pathogen dispersal at the [University of Cambridge](https://plantepidemics.github.io); you may view my profile [here](https://www.plantsci.cam.ac.uk/staff/mr-vedang-joshi).

I have recently joined the [Hauert Lab](https://hauertlab.com) at the [Bristol Robotics Laboratory](https://www.bristolroboticslab.com) as a masters student to work on my dissertation this year. I'll be joining the bio-inspired robotic fish research, working on using machine learning techniques to teach swimming agents to school together using only pressure data. This project is follow-up to a project that has already demonstrated that a single agent is able to navigate the flow field behind a cylinder using only pressure data. The project will be extended to several swimming agents and whether the fish shoaling behaviour emerges out of responses to flows behind cylinders. Moving the model to a multi-agent system with more realistic wakes represents a significant step forward in increasing the realism of the model, and it has the scope to inform the control systems of a currently running project to create robotic fish that navigate using a pressure sensor.

In my spare time I enjoy reading crime fiction and medical thrillers. I love travelling and meeting new people and have travelled across Europe, through South East Asia and North America. I am a Silver and Gold [Duke of Edinburgh Award](https://www.dofe.org/about/) holder and enjoy hiking in my spare time having hiked extensively in the Western Ghats in India, Dartmoor in Devon, Brecon Beacons in Wales and in the Lake District in Northern England.
