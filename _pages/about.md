## About Me

I'm a software engineer at [Boeing UK](https://www.boeing.co.uk) alongside working towards a part-time PhD in [Computational Engineering](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/vedang-joshi) at [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/), under the supervision of [Dr. Julia Li](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/juan-li) and [Prof. David Moxey](https://davidmoxey.uk/). Prior to this, I graduated from the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk) with an MEng (Hons) in [Engineering Mathematics](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/2025/engineering-maths/meng-engineering-mathematics/) in 2022.

## Research Interests

My research interests lie at the interface of mathematics and biology. Specifically, I'm interested in developing theoretical and computational models to analyse vortex shedding and the role of trailing and leading edge vortices in incompressible flows, and apply these ideas to fish schooling mechanism research.

In 2021, I joined the [Hauert Lab](https://hauertlab.com) at the [Bristol Robotics Laboratory](https://www.bristolroboticslab.com) to work on my masters [dissertation](https://vedang-joshi.github.io/files/Vedang_Joshi_Dissertation.pdf), supervised by [Prof. Sabine Hauert](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/sabine-hauert) and [Dr. Elliott Scott](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/elliott-j-scott-2). I developed a mechanistic framework to teach swimming agents to school together solely using pressure data. This project was a follow-up to a project that has already demonstrated that a single agent is able to navigate the flow field behind a cylinder using pressure data. The project was extended to several swimming agents to find out whether shoaling behaviour emerges out of responses to flows behind cylinders. 

## Past Research Experience
In the summer of 2021, I worked on epidemic spread for the Citrus Huanglongbing disease using stochastic methods. I also worked on how road networks act as potential vectors for plant pathogen dispersal. Both projects were based at the [University of Cambridge](https://plantepidemics.github.io). In the summer of 2020, I worked on gene essentiality in mitochondrial protein-protein interaction networks at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/biomathematics-group/).

## Other stuff

In my spare time, I enjoy reading crime fiction and medical thrillers. I love travelling and meeting new people and have travelled across Europe, through South East Asia and North America. I'm a Silver and Gold [Duke of Edinburgh Award](https://www.dofe.org/about/) holder and have hiked extensively in the Western Ghats, India; Dartmoor, Devon; Brecon Beacons, Wales and in the Lake District, Northern England. I'm currently an [Ocean Diver](https://www.bsac.com/training/learn-to-scuba-dive/ocean-diver-course/#tab-1) at the [Holborn Sub-Aqua Club](https://www.holbornscubalondon.co.uk/).
