I'm a Rotational Graduate engineer at [Boeing UK](https://www.boeing.co.uk/boeing-in-the-uk.page). I completed my undergraduate and graduate studies in [Engineering Mathematics](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/departments/engineering-mathematics/) at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk). I'm originally from [Pune, India](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pune,+Maharashtra,+India/@18.5246164,73.8629674,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x3bc2bf2e67461101:0x828d43bf9d9ee343!8m2!3d18.5204303!4d73.8567437), where I spent some of my childhood, the rest of which I spent in [Swindon, UK](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Swindon/@51.5688109,-1.8273244,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4871444f3ddbe4e5:0xa556bf37e9c5949a!8m2!3d51.5583777!4d-1.7809759).

My research interests lie at the interface of mathematics and biology. Specifically, I'm interested in bio-inspired robotics and non-linear dynamics and its applications in emergent phenomena and the study of fluid dynamics respectively. In the autumn of 2022, I joined the [Hauert Lab](https://hauertlab.com) at the [Bristol Robotics Laboratory](https://www.bristolroboticslab.com) to work on my masters dissertation, supervised by [Dr. Elliott Scott](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/elliott-j-scott-2) and [Dr. Sabine Hauert](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/sabine-hauert). I worked alongside the bio-inspired robotic fish research group, developing a mechanistic framework to teach swimming agents to school together using only pressure data. This project was a follow-up to a project that has already demonstrated that a single agent is able to navigate the flow field behind a cylinder using only pressure data. The project was extended to several swimming agents to find out if shoaling behaviour emerges out of responses to flows behind cylinders. In the summer of 2021, I worked on epidemic spread for the Citrus Huanglongbing disease using stochastic methods. I also worked on how road networks act as potential vectors for plant pathogen dispersal. Both projects were based at the [University of Cambridge](https://plantepidemics.github.io). In the summer of 2020, I worked on gene essentiality in mitochondrial protein-protein interaction networks at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/biomathematics-group/).

In my spare time, I enjoy reading crime fiction and medical thrillers. I love travelling and meeting new people and have travelled across Europe, through South East Asia and North America. I'm a Silver and Gold [Duke of Edinburgh Award](https://www.dofe.org/about/) holder and enjoy hiking in my spare time having hiked extensively in the Western Ghats, India; Dartmoor in Devon; Brecon Beacons, Wales and in the Lake District, Northern England.
