## About Me

I'm a graduate project engineer at [Boeing UK](https://www.boeing.co.uk/boeing-in-the-uk.page) based in [Gosport](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gosport/@50.8068225,-1.1855995,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x487466142f9bda5f:0x5312889e08c5e933!8m2!3d50.794995!4d-1.117547). I'm working as part of the Systems Engineering, Integration and Test (SEIT) team, maintaining and supporting aircraft modifications. I graduated from the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk) with an MEng in [Engineering Mathematics](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/departments/engineering-mathematics/) in 2022.

## Research Interests

My research interests lie at the interface of mathematics and biology. Specifically, I'm interested in bio-inspired robotics and its applications in emergent phenomena. In the autumn of 2021, I joined the [Hauert Lab](https://hauertlab.com) at the [Bristol Robotics Laboratory](https://www.bristolroboticslab.com) to work on my masters dissertation, supervised by [Dr. Elliott Scott](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/elliott-j-scott-2) and [Prof. Sabine Hauert](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/sabine-hauert). I worked alongside the bio-inspired robotic fish research group, developing a mechanistic framework to teach swimming agents to school together solely using pressure data. This project was a follow-up to a project that has already demonstrated that a single agent is able to navigate the flow field behind a cylinder using pressure data. The project was extended to several swimming agents to find out whether shoaling behaviour emerges out of responses to flows behind cylinders. 

## Past Experiences
In the summer of 2021, I worked on epidemic spread for the Citrus Huanglongbing disease using stochastic methods. I also worked on how road networks act as potential vectors for plant pathogen dispersal. Both projects were based at the [University of Cambridge](https://plantepidemics.github.io). In the summer of 2020, I worked on gene essentiality in mitochondrial protein-protein interaction networks at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/biomathematics-group/).

## Other stuff

In my spare time, I enjoy reading crime fiction and medical thrillers. I love travelling and meeting new people and have travelled across Europe, through South East Asia and North America. I'm a Silver and Gold [Duke of Edinburgh Award](https://www.dofe.org/about/) holder and have hiked extensively in the Western Ghats, India; Dartmoor in Devon; Brecon Beacons, Wales and in the Lake District, Northern England. More recently, I'm planning on obtaining a scuba diving licence through the [University of Portsmouth Sub-Aqua Club](https://www.upsac.co.uk/).
