I am a third year undergraduate at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk) studying for an integrated masters degree in [Engineering Mathematics](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/departments/engineering-mathematics/). I am originally from Pune, India, where I spent some of my childhood, the rest of which I spent in the UK. It was during my talks with a cousin of mine who works in systems biology along with the projects I'd done at school and university, that I realised the potential of mathematical modelling to understand biological systems - I was hooked! 

My area of interest lies at the interface of mathematics and biology. Specifically, I wish to use network theory and other mathematical tools such as non-linear dynamics to study complex systems and emergent phenomena which is useful to model animal behaviour. I've studied gene essentiality in mitochondrial protein interaction networks, and currently I'm working on epidemiological dynamics projects at the University of Cambridge.
