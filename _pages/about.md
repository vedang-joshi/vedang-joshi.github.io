I am a fourth year student at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk) studying for an integrated masters degree in [Engineering Mathematics](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/departments/engineering-mathematics/). I am originally from Pune, India, where I spent some of my childhood, the rest of which I spent in Swindon, United Kingdom. It was during my talks with a cousin of mine who works in systems biology along with the projects I'd done at school and university, that I realised the potential of mathematical modelling to understand biological systems - I was hooked! 

My research interests lie at the interface of mathematics and biology. Specifically, I use network theory and non-linear dynamics to study complex systems and emergent phenomena which is useful to model animal behaviour. I've worked on gene essentiality in mitochondrial protein interaction networks at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/biomathematics-group/), and currently I'm working on some epidemiological dynamics projects at the [University of Cambridge](https://plantepidemics.github.io); you may view my profile [here](https://www.plantsci.cam.ac.uk/staff/mr-vedang-joshi).

I have recently joined the [Hauert Lab](https://hauertlab.com) at the [Bristol Robotics Laboratory](https://www.bristolroboticslab.com) as a masters student to work on my dissertation this year. I'll be joining the bio-inspired robotic fish research, working on using machine learning techniques to teach swimming agents to school together using only pressure data. This project is follow-up to a project that has already demonstrated that a single agent is able to navigate the flow field behind a cylinder using only pressure data. However, while the wake behind a cylinder, a Karman vortex street, is similar to the wake generated by a swimming fish, a reverse Karman vortex street, it is not the same. Moving the model to a multi-agent system with more realistic wakes represents a significant step forward in increasing the realism of the model, and it has the scope to inform the control systems of a currently running project to create robotic fish that navigate using a pressure sensor.

In my spare time I enjoy reading crime fiction and medical thrillers. I love travelling and meeting new people and have travelled across Europe, through South East Asia and North America. I am a Silver and Gold [Duke of Edinburgh Award](https://www.dofe.org/about/) holder and enjoy hiking in my spare time having hiked extensively in the Western Ghats in India, Dartmoor in Devon and Brecon Beacons in Wales.
