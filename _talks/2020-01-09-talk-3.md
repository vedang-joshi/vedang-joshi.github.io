I along with members of the Urban Gulls Project at the University of Bristol Fluid and Aerodynamics Research Group gave a presentation to a group of 20 children (aged 12-14) on how engineers look to the natural world for design inspiration. We then gave the children miniature drones and mathematical modelling problems for them to engage with after the demonstration.
